# Z_N STRUCTURE EMULATION

## About the project
* Served as a project for the course "Mathematical Methods for Computing & Algorithms" from the IT Master class - HCMUS

* Focusing in:
    1. Simulating Z_n and doing +, -, * with integers
    2. Finding multiplicative inverse of an integer (if exists, i.e. when it's coprime with n)
    3. Doing fast modular exponentiation
